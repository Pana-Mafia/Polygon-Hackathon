**DeVision**

# About Project(2-3 lines)

We try to visualize "hidden" contribution in DAO.

By using Devision, you can see all commits on github and can post comments to thank others.

When you finish building, all contributors can get NFT their contribution was written.

# the problem it is solving

DAO's "Retroactive rewards" tends to distribute to those people who are "good at describing their contributions".

This product can visualize each member's contribution in DAO.

Particularly, we focus on visualizing contribution when we develop a new product.
By inviting our github account to your repository, you can see all branches and every commits.

And you can also leave comments to anyone in order to reveal other's "hidden" commitments and praise them.

When you finish building, an NFT that has visualization of your contribution is minted and transferred to you.

You can also distribute rewords of building depending on amounts of each member's commits on github and comments they get.

# Challenges faced

- It is so hard to import github to visualize menber's commitment.
- When building NFT minting feature, I don't know how to write text and add properties. But UNCHAIN lesson is so helpful! I love UNCHAIN lesson and it's community! :)
- We made NFT "Non-Transferrable" in order to prove that the owner is the truly contributor.
- Building time is so short that we made a lot of effort to complete hacking in 24 hours. ðŸ¥º
